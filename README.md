This is a show off Android application for my portfolio.

It showcases material design, animations, proper REST communication as well as Model-View-Presenter code architecture.

Connects to [Warsaw University's Usos installation](https://apps.usos.edu.pl/developers/api/) (University managment framework) through REST api
and downloads a list of faculties and connected information (a photo, phone number and address). And then shows the data in a neat list.
