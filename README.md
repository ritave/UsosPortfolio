Usos Portfolio

This is a show off Android application for my portfolio. [It can be seen on Play Store here.](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=me.tomalka.usosportfolio)

It showcases material design, animations, proper REST communication as well as Model-View-Presenter code architecture.

Connects to Warsaw University's Usos installation ([APIs here](https://apps.usos.edu.pl/developers/api/) and what [students see, here](https://usosweb.uw.edu.pl/kontroler.php?_action=actionx:news/default()&lang=en)) (University managment framework) through REST api
and downloads a list of faculties and connected information (a photo, phone number and address). And then shows the data in a neat list.
